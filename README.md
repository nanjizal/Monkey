# Monkey
[Monkey demo](https://rawgit.com/nanjizal/Monkey/master/build/html5/index.html)

Monkey single class demo based on cutdown and extension of https://github.com/Kha-Samples/Kharira

Has a hundred material embedded and animated unicorns embedded ( base64 ). Allows you to rotate using keyboard and mouse, partially uses Quaterions to help with rotation. Very heavy works better on Chrome.

( Currently needs old version of Kha so will not work out of the box unless you have right kha version. )
